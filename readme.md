cweþan(pronounced "kweh-than") is a simple, minimalist and aesthetic quotes site.

## Features
- Display random quotes
- Simple and clean user interface
- Lightweight and fast
- No dependencies required

Currently, all the quotes are added manually. In future updates, I plan to integrate an API to fetch quotes dynamically.

## Local Installation 
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## Usage
Simply open the [website](https://xn--cwean-yva.seneth.me/) or the `index.html` file in a web browser to view random quotes. Click the "New Quote" button or press 'Enter' or the 'Right Arrow' key to see a different quote. Go back to the previous quote using the 'Left Arrow' key. You can also like quotes and view them on a separate page.
